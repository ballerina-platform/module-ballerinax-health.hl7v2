Package containing HL7v2.3 to FHIR pre-built mapping functionalities. 

# HL7v2 to FHIR Package

## Package Overview

This package implements the HL7 version 2.3 to FHIR implementation guide (https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/v2-to-fhir/branches/master/datatype_maps.html). 

### Note: 
From Ballerina Swan Lake Update 10 upwards, `--optimize-dependency-compilation` flag is
introduced to optimize the memory usage during the compilation time. 
Use the flag in the build command as follows,

`bal build --optimize-dependency-compilation`

or add as a config in the `Ballerina.toml` file.

```
[build-options]
optimizeDependencyCompilation = true
```
